      <chapter number="11">
        <verse number="1">As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse number="2">saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</verse>
        <verse number="3">If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"</verse>
        <verse number="4">They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it,</verse>
        <verse number="5">some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?"</verse>
        <verse number="6">They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.</verse>
        <verse number="7">When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.</verse>
        <verse number="8">Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.</verse>
        <verse number="9">Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"</verse>
        <verse number="10">"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!Hosanna in the highest!"</verse>
        <verse number="11">Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse number="12">The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.</verse>
        <verse number="13">Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.</verse>
        <verse number="14">Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.</verse>
        <verse number="15">On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,</verse>
        <verse number="16">and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.</verse>
        <verse number="17">And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: "'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"</verse>
        <verse number="18">The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse number="19">When evening came, they went out of the city.</verse>
        <verse number="20">In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</verse>
        <verse number="21">Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!"</verse>
        <verse number="22">"Have faith in God," Jesus answered.</verse>
        <verse number="23">"I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.</verse>
        <verse number="24">Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</verse>
        <verse number="25">And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."</verse>
        <verse number="26">See Footnote</verse>
        <verse number="27">They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.</verse>
        <verse number="28">"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?"</verse>
        <verse number="29">Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</verse>
        <verse number="30">John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!"</verse>
        <verse number="31">They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'</verse>
        <verse number="32">But if we say, 'From men'...." (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)</verse>
        <verse number="33">So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter number="12">
        <verse number="1">He then began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.</verse>
        <verse number="2">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse number="3">But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse number="4">Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.</verse>
        <verse number="5">He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.</verse>
        <verse number="6">"He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.'</verse>
        <verse number="7">"But the tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</verse>
        <verse number="8">So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse number="9">"What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse number="10">Haven't you read this scripture: "'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone;</verse>
        <verse number="11">the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</verse>
        <verse number="12">Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse number="13">Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.</verse>
        <verse number="14">They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?</verse>
        <verse number="15">Should we pay or shouldn't we?"</verse>
        <verse number="16">But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. "Why are you trying to trap me?" he asked. "Bring me a denarius and let me look at it." They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?Caesar's," they replied.</verse>
        <verse number="17">Then Jesus said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.</verse>
        <verse number="18">Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</verse>
        <verse number="19">"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse number="20">Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.</verse>
        <verse number="21">The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third.</verse>
        <verse number="22">In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.</verse>
        <verse number="23">At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"</verse>
        <verse number="24">Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?</verse>
        <verse number="25">When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse number="26">Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?</verse>
        <verse number="27">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"</verse>
        <verse number="28">One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"</verse>
        <verse number="29">"The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</verse>
        <verse number="30">Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'</verse>
        <verse number="31">The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."</verse>
        <verse number="32">"Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.</verse>
        <verse number="33">To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."</verse>
        <verse number="34">When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.</verse>
        <verse number="35">While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David?</verse>
        <verse number="36">David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: "'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."'</verse>
        <verse number="37">David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.</verse>
        <verse number="38">As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces,</verse>
        <verse number="39">and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</verse>
        <verse number="40">They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."</verse>
        <verse number="41">Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.</verse>
        <verse number="42">But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny.</verse>
        <verse number="43">Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.</verse>
        <verse number="44">They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter number="13">
        <verse number="1">As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!"</verse>
        <verse number="2">"Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."</verse>
        <verse number="3">As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately,</verse>
        <verse number="4">"Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?"</verse>
        <verse number="5">Jesus said to them: "Watch out that no one deceives you.</verse>
        <verse number="6">Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many.</verse>
        <verse number="7">When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.</verse>
        <verse number="8">Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.</verse>
        <verse number="9">"You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.</verse>
        <verse number="10">And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.</verse>
        <verse number="11">Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse number="12">"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.</verse>
        <verse number="13">All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.</verse>
        <verse number="14">"When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</verse>
        <verse number="15">Let no one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out.</verse>
        <verse number="16">Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak.</verse>
        <verse number="17">How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!</verse>
        <verse number="18">Pray that this will not take place in winter,</verse>
        <verse number="19">because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now--and never to be equaled again.</verse>
        <verse number="20">If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.</verse>
        <verse number="21">At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.</verse>
        <verse number="22">For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect--if that were possible.</verse>
        <verse number="23">So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.</verse>
        <verse number="24">"But in those days, following that distress, "'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;</verse>
        <verse number="25">the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'</verse>
        <verse number="26">"At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</verse>
        <verse number="27">And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse number="28">"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.</verse>
        <verse number="29">Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door.</verse>
        <verse number="30">I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.</verse>
        <verse number="31">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</verse>
        <verse number="32">"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.</verse>
        <verse number="33">Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.</verse>
        <verse number="34">It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.</verse>
        <verse number="35">"Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back--whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn.</verse>
        <verse number="36">If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.</verse>
        <verse number="37">What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!'"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter number="14">
        <verse number="1">Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him.</verse>
        <verse number="2">"But not during the Feast," they said, "or the people may riot."</verse>
        <verse number="3">While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</verse>
        <verse number="4">Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume?</verse>
        <verse number="5">It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked her harshly.</verse>
        <verse number="6">"Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</verse>
        <verse number="7">The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.</verse>
        <verse number="8">She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.</verse>
        <verse number="9">I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."</verse>
        <verse number="10">Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.</verse>
        <verse number="11">They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.</verse>
        <verse number="12">On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"</verse>
        <verse number="13">So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.</verse>
        <verse number="14">Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'</verse>
        <verse number="15">He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."</verse>
        <verse number="16">The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse number="17">When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse number="18">While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."</verse>
        <verse number="19">They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely not I?"</verse>
        <verse number="20">"It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me.</verse>
        <verse number="21">The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."</verse>
        <verse number="22">While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."</verse>
        <verse number="23">Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.</verse>
        <verse number="24">"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them.</verse>
        <verse number="25">"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse number="26">When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse number="27">"You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written: "'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'</verse>
        <verse number="28">But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."</verse>
        <verse number="29">Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."</verse>
        <verse number="30">"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times."</verse>
        <verse number="31">But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same.</verse>
        <verse number="32">They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."</verse>
        <verse number="33">He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.</verse>
        <verse number="34">"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch."</verse>
        <verse number="35">Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.</verse>
        <verse number="36">"Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."</verse>
        <verse number="37">Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?</verse>
        <verse number="38">Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."</verse>
        <verse number="39">Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.</verse>
        <verse number="40">When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.</verse>
        <verse number="41">Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse number="42">Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"</verse>
        <verse number="43">Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.</verse>
        <verse number="44">Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."</verse>
        <verse number="45">Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse number="46">The men seized Jesus and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse number="47">Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse number="48">"Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?</verse>
        <verse number="49">Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse number="50">Then everyone deserted him and fled.</verse>
        <verse number="51">A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,</verse>
        <verse number="52">he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.</verse>
        <verse number="53">They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together.</verse>
        <verse number="54">Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.</verse>
        <verse number="55">The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.</verse>
        <verse number="56">Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.</verse>
        <verse number="57">Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:</verse>
        <verse number="58">"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'"</verse>
        <verse number="59">Yet even then their testimony did not agree.</verse>
        <verse number="60">Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"</verse>
        <verse number="61">But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?"</verse>
        <verse number="62">"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse number="63">The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.</verse>
        <verse number="64">"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?"</verse>
        <verse number="65">They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.</verse>
        <verse number="66">While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.</verse>
        <verse number="67">When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.</verse>
        <verse number="68">But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway.</verse>
        <verse number="69">When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."</verse>
        <verse number="70">Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."</verse>
        <verse number="71">He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."</verse>
        <verse number="72">Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.</verse>

      <chapter number="15">
        <verse number="1">Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse number="2">"Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</verse>
        <verse number="3">The chief priests accused him of many things.</verse>
        <verse number="4">So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of."</verse>
        <verse number="5">But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.</verse>
        <verse number="6">Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.</verse>
        <verse number="7">A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.</verse>
        <verse number="8">The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.</verse>
        <verse number="9">"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate,</verse>
        <verse number="10">knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</verse>
        <verse number="11">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.</verse>
        <verse number="12">"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them.</verse>
        <verse number="13">"Crucify him!" they shouted.</verse>
        <verse number="14">"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse number="15">Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse number="16">The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.</verse>
        <verse number="17">They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.</verse>
        <verse number="18">And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse number="19">Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</verse>
        <verse number="20">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse number="21">A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.</verse>
        <verse number="22">They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).</verse>
        <verse number="23">Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.</verse>
        <verse number="24">And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.</verse>
        <verse number="25">It was the third hour when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse number="26">The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse number="27">They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse number="28">See Footnote</verse>
        <verse number="29">Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse number="30">come down from the cross and save yourself!"</verse>
        <verse number="31">In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself!</verse>
        <verse number="32">Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</verse>
        <verse number="33">At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse number="34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse number="35">When some of those standing near heard this, they said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah."</verse>
        <verse number="36">One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said.</verse>
        <verse number="37">With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse number="38">The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse number="39">And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse number="40">Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</verse>
        <verse number="41">In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.</verse>
        <verse number="42">It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,</verse>
        <verse number="43">Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.</verse>
        <verse number="44">Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.</verse>
        <verse number="45">When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse number="46">So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse number="47">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</verse>
