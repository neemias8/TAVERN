      <chapter number="19">
        <verse number="29">As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them,</verse>
        <verse number="30">"Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</verse>
        <verse number="31">If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it.'"</verse>
        <verse number="32">Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse number="33">As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?"</verse>
        <verse number="34">They replied, "The Lord needs it."</verse>
        <verse number="35">They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse number="36">As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.</verse>
        <verse number="37">When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:</verse>
        <verse number="38">"Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"</verse>
        <verse number="39">Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"</verse>
        <verse number="40">"I tell you," he replied, "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out."</verse>
        <verse number="41">As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it</verse>
        <verse number="42">and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse number="43">The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.</verse>
        <verse number="44">They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you."</verse>
        <verse number="45">Then he entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling.</verse>
        <verse number="46">"It is written," he said to them, "'My house will be a house of prayer'; but you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"</verse>
        <verse number="47">Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.</verse>
        <verse number="48">Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter number="20">
        <verse number="1">One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him.</verse>
        <verse number="2">"Tell us by what authority you are doing these things," they said. "Who gave you this authority?"</verse>
        <verse number="3">He replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me,</verse>
        <verse number="4">John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men?"</verse>
        <verse number="5">They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?'</verse>
        <verse number="6">But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet."</verse>
        <verse number="7">So they answered, "We don't know where it was from."</verse>
        <verse number="8">Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</verse>
        <verse number="9">He went on to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.</verse>
        <verse number="10">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse number="11">He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse number="12">He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</verse>
        <verse number="13">"Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.'</verse>
        <verse number="14">"But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. 'This is the heir,' they said. 'Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</verse>
        <verse number="15">So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</verse>
        <verse number="16">"What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others." When the people heard this, they said, "May this never be!"</verse>
        <verse number="17">Jesus looked directly at them and asked, "Then what is the meaning of that which is written: "'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone '?</verse>
        <verse number="18">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed."</verse>
        <verse number="19">The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.</verse>
        <verse number="20">Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse number="21">So the spies questioned him: "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.</verse>
        <verse number="22">Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</verse>
        <verse number="23">He saw through their duplicity and said to them,</verse>
        <verse number="24">"Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and inscription are on it?"</verse>
        <verse number="25">"Caesar's," they replied. He said to them, "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."</verse>
        <verse number="26">They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.</verse>
        <verse number="27">Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.</verse>
        <verse number="28">"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.</verse>
        <verse number="29">Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.</verse>
        <verse number="30">The second</verse>
        <verse number="31">and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.</verse>
        <verse number="32">Finally, the woman died too.</verse>
        <verse number="33">Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"</verse>
        <verse number="34">Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse number="35">But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse number="36">and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse number="37">But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'</verse>
        <verse number="38">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."</verse>
        <verse number="39">Some of the teachers of the law responded, "Well said, teacher!"</verse>
        <verse number="40">And no one dared to ask him any more questions.</verse>
        <verse number="41">Then Jesus said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse number="42">David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: "'The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand</verse>
        <verse number="43">until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'</verse>
        <verse number="44">David calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?"</verse>
        <verse number="45">While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse number="46">"Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</verse>
        <verse number="47">They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter number="21">
        <verse number="1">As he looked up, Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury.</verse>
        <verse number="2">He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins.</verse>
        <verse number="3">"I tell you the truth," he said, "this poor widow has put in more than all the others.</verse>
        <verse number="4">All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on."</verse>
        <verse number="5">Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said,</verse>
        <verse number="6">"As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down."</verse>
        <verse number="7">"Teacher," they asked, "when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?"</verse>
        <verse number="8">He replied: "Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them.</verse>
        <verse number="9">When you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away."</verse>
        <verse number="10">Then he said to them: "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
        <verse number="11">There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.</verse>
        <verse number="12">"But before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name.</verse>
        <verse number="13">This will result in your being witnesses to them.</verse>
        <verse number="14">But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.</verse>
        <verse number="15">For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.</verse>
        <verse number="16">You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death.</verse>
        <verse number="17">All men will hate you because of me.</verse>
        <verse number="18">But not a hair of your head will perish.</verse>
        <verse number="19">By standing firm you will gain life.</verse>
        <verse number="20">"When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near.</verse>
        <verse number="21">Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.</verse>
        <verse number="22">For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written.</verse>
        <verse number="23">How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.</verse>
        <verse number="24">They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse number="25">"There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.</verse>
        <verse number="26">Men will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.</verse>
        <verse number="27">At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</verse>
        <verse number="28">When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."</verse>
        <verse number="29">He told them this parable: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees.</verse>
        <verse number="30">When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.</verse>
        <verse number="31">Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.</verse>
        <verse number="32">"I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.</verse>
        <verse number="33">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</verse>
        <verse number="34">"Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap.</verse>
        <verse number="35">For it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse number="36">Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man."</verse>
        <verse number="37">Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives,</verse>
        <verse number="38">and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter number="22">
        <verse number="1">Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,</verse>
        <verse number="2">and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.</verse>
        <verse number="3">Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse number="4">And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.</verse>
        <verse number="5">They were delighted and agreed to give him money.</verse>
        <verse number="6">He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.</verse>
        <verse number="7">Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse number="8">Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover."</verse>
        <verse number="9">"Where do you want us to prepare for it?" they asked.</verse>
        <verse number="10">He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,</verse>
        <verse number="11">and say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'</verse>
        <verse number="12">He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there."</verse>
        <verse number="13">They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse number="14">When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.</verse>
        <verse number="15">And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</verse>
        <verse number="16">For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse number="17">After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among you.</verse>
        <verse number="18">For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."</verse>
        <verse number="19">And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me."</verse>
        <verse number="20">In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</verse>
        <verse number="21">But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.</verse>
        <verse number="22">The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him."</verse>
        <verse number="23">They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.</verse>
        <verse number="24">Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.</verse>
        <verse number="25">Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.</verse>
        <verse number="26">But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.</verse>
        <verse number="27">For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</verse>
        <verse number="28">You are those who have stood by me in my trials.</verse>
        <verse number="29">And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,</verse>
        <verse number="30">so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse number="31">"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.</verse>
        <verse number="32">But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."</verse>
        <verse number="33">But he replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."</verse>
        <verse number="34">Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."</verse>
        <verse number="35">Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?Nothing," they answered.</verse>
        <verse number="36">He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</verse>
        <verse number="37">It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment."</verse>
        <verse number="38">The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords.That is enough," he replied.</verse>
        <verse number="39">Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse number="40">On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."</verse>
        <verse number="41">He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse number="42">"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."</verse>
        <verse number="43">An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.</verse>
        <verse number="44">And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.</verse>
        <verse number="45">When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse number="46">"Why are you sleeping?" he asked them. "Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."</verse>
        <verse number="47">While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,</verse>
        <verse number="48">but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"</verse>
        <verse number="49">When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"</verse>
        <verse number="50">And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse number="51">But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.</verse>
        <verse number="52">Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</verse>
        <verse number="53">Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns."</verse>
        <verse number="54">Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</verse>
        <verse number="55">But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.</verse>
        <verse number="56">A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him."</verse>
        <verse number="57">But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know him," he said.</verse>
        <verse number="58">A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them.Man, I am not!" Peter replied.</verse>
        <verse number="59">About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean."</verse>
        <verse number="60">Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse number="61">The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."</verse>
        <verse number="62">And he went outside and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse number="63">The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.</verse>
        <verse number="64">They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?"</verse>
        <verse number="65">And they said many other insulting things to him.</verse>
        <verse number="66">At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.</verse>
        <verse number="67">"If you are the Christ, "they said, "tell us."</verse>
        <verse number="68">Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me, and if I asked you, you would not answer.</verse>
        <verse number="69">But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."</verse>
        <verse number="70">They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You are right in saying I am."</verse>
        <verse number="71">Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter number="23">
        <verse number="1">Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse number="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, "We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Christ, a king."</verse>
        <verse number="3">So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</verse>
        <verse number="4">Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."</verse>
        <verse number="5">But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here."</verse>
        <verse number="6">On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse number="7">When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse number="8">When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle.</verse>
        <verse number="9">He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse number="10">The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
        <verse number="11">Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse number="12">That day Herod and Pilate became friends--before this they had been enemies.</verse>
        <verse number="13">Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people,</verse>
        <verse number="14">and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.</verse>
        <verse number="15">Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death.</verse>
        <verse number="16">Therefore, I will punish him and then release him."</verse>
        <verse number="17">See Footnote</verse>
        <verse number="18">With one voice they cried out, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!"</verse>
        <verse number="19">(Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)</verse>
        <verse number="20">Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.</verse>
        <verse number="21">But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse number="22">For the third time he spoke to them: "Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him."</verse>
        <verse number="23">But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.</verse>
        <verse number="24">So Pilate decided to grant their demand.</verse>
        <verse number="25">He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse number="26">As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse number="27">A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.</verse>
        <verse number="28">Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse number="29">For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'</verse>
        <verse number="30">Then "'they will say to the mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!"'</verse>
        <verse number="31">For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"</verse>
        <verse number="32">Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed.</verse>
        <verse number="33">When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals--one on his right, the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse number="34">Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse number="35">The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One."</verse>
        <verse number="36">The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar</verse>
        <verse number="37">and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."</verse>
        <verse number="38">There was a written notice above him, which read:|sc THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse number="39">One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"</verse>
        <verse number="40">But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence?</verse>
        <verse number="41">We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."</verse>
        <verse number="42">Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. "</verse>
        <verse number="43">Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."</verse>
        <verse number="44">It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,</verse>
        <verse number="45">for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.</verse>
        <verse number="46">Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse number="47">The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man."</verse>
        <verse number="48">When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.</verse>
        <verse number="49">But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</verse>
        <verse number="50">Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man,</verse>
        <verse number="51">who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse number="52">Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body.</verse>
        <verse number="53">Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse number="54">It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</verse>
        <verse number="55">The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.</verse>
        <verse number="56">Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.</verse>
