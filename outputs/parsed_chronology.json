LaGard Smith, though I have made some adjustments of my own. (See index.html #Sources  for more information.) The page numbers in the last column of the table are from that book. (When I have significantly changed the order these are marked in green .) However, Smith never explains wh ich Gospel Harmony he followed, and in fact he has graciou sly explained to me that after 35 years he no longer has his original notes and cannot remember. I still consider his basic framework to be an excellent one  and have mostly followed it, but recently for certain details I have come to  rely on the monumental  work Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary , by William Hendriksen and Simon Kistemaker , the four gospels by Hendriksen .23 He goes into great detail in explaining the sequence of many events. For this reason, and because I had unnecessarily summarized several sections, i n June, 2020 I went into greater detail about many events , especially  in the book of Luke , which has more unique material than Matthew or Mark , and rearranged some of these based on Hendriksen \u2019s logic.  I also  added information on the Five Discourses  of Jesus in  Matthew . In any case t his chronology should not be viewed  as authoritative or inspired, but only as a helpful arrangement of the four gospels to show their relative chronology, using the key events marked with \u2020, as shown below.  Other s have also made  arrangements that are equally well thought through . However , the 3 \u00bd-year framework seems to be the general consensus  (see this page ), as well as many of the details included here (see this page ). Colors, Formatt ing, and Symbols Red text A key date or timespan provided in the text, or that can be calculated from it. The text that provides it is also in red. A few events cannot be dated, but are key in determining the order of other events, like the imprisonment of John the Baptist or his execution; these are also marked in red. Purple  text Other time information  provided in the text, or that can be calculated from it, such as \u201c the next day \u201d or \u201c on a Sabbath \u201d. This information is only relative, showing the time between two or more events, even though these cannot be dated in the larger context.  (Note that before the beginning of Jesus\u2019 ministry and fr om the last week of his ministry onwards, all time information is colored red, not purple , since all of this time information is key and is datable in the larger context.) \u2020 This symbol indicates key events that allow us to construct this chronology, and to align the four gospels into one chronology. The synoptic gospels  (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) tend to cover the same events and teaching, whereas John tends to cover quite different events and teaching, which makes it a bit difficult to align the synoptics  with John. Even so, because of the few times they do cover the same events it is possible to develop this chronology. Orange line in left margin  This shows the extent of what is known as the Great Galilean Ministry , which lasted about a year and a half, from around December of the year 27 until after Passover in the year 29. During this period Jesus spent most of his time in Galilee, and his ministry was very public. Formatting of References in Columns 4 through 7 Bold  and outlined  The most complete or key passage, or a passage with important additional information. Blue  outline  A passage outside of the four gospels  that provide s further information within the context of the four gospels . Yellow background  A passage that is not in chronological order in one of the gospels (or at least that The Narrated Bible  organized in a different order). Mark and John seem to be almost entirel y chronological, but often Matthew is not, and sometimes Luke is not.  (In each case when Mark and John do not agree, a choice has been made to follow one or the other. However, these conflicts  only occur  in The Last Week of the Ministry of Jesus , and mostl y represent quite minor variation s, except where clarified by a footnote.) Sky-blue background  A passage that is not actually out of order, but which refers forward or backward to another event, and so is placed out of order. Chronology of the Four Gospels  9 Rick Aschmann, last updated 11-Feb-2022  (in parentheses)  A passage that actually occurs elsewhere, but which provides information about an event which it does not directly narrate. [grey and  in brackets]  A passage that might appear to be a parallel passage, but which was probably a separate event or a repeated teaching. The context is what normally indicates this. (I have not included these exhaustively, since Jesus frequently taught similar things, and they would not all fit in this chart. I have only included some of the more obvi ously similar repeated teachings.)24 Thick green line at  Indicates a place where chronological order was followed, except that one or more passages with a yellow background  or a sky-blue background  were moved elsewhere, leaving a nonsequential break.25 top of reference Endnotes: 1 The return from Egypt occurred after the death of Herod the Great, who most likely died in March or April of 4 B.C.  If Jesus\u2019 ministry began in early 27 A.D., this makes his age right at 30, as stated in Luke 3:23, if we assume that he was born not long be fore that. Remember, there is no year 0! However, many commentators have assumed that the two -year figure in Matthew 2:16 means that Jesus was already two years old by the time of the arrival of the wise men, and that t he phrase \u201cabout thirty years of age\u201d  in Luke 3:23 could mean up to 32. On the other hand, many other commentators, including such well -respected ones as Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary  and Alfred Edersheim, have said that we need not assume this, and that it fits the character of the wicked  king Herod to have gone overboard in his killing of the infants. As Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary  says, \u201c When it came to killing, Herod always allowed himself a very wide margin. \u201d For this reason I have simply said that Jesus was probably born sometime between 6 and 4 B.C. 2 See this page , this page , and this page  for why the time frame mentioned in Luke 3:1 for the start of John\u2019s ministry would have occurred in the latter part of 26 A. D. 3 And very probably also Joh n, who may have been the other disciple who is not named. See footnote 19. These are 3 of the four fishermen who receive a more \u201cofficial\u201d call later on at the Sea  of Galilee (Lake Gennesaret ), mentioned only in the Synoptic Gospels. See Apostles.html . 4 According to John 2:20 this occurred 46 years after Herod the Great began reconstructing the temple, which  occurred in the 18th year of his reign (20 -19 B.C.) , which con - firms that Jesus began his ministry and cleared the temple in 27 A.D., which is also indicated fro m several other evidences. (Remember, there is no year 0!) 5 I realized in January, 2022 that I needed to put a n endnote to explain  how John 4:35 shows that these events occurred in December. In John 4:35 Jesus says, \u201cDo you not say, \u2018 Four months more and then the harvest \u2019? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.\u201d Clearly the second part of the verse is metaphorical, but what does the first part mean? In the context it sounds like a proverb, but in fact it only make s sense if it actually indicates the present situation at the time Jesus said it. Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary  affirms this, and says,  \u201cThe harvest in this region being in April (or early May), it was now December (or early January)\u201d. 6 Baker\u2019s New Tes tament Commentary  points out that the Luke account here is quite different from the Matthew and Mark accounts, and suggests a prior acquaintanc e and that this is a later event. This also avoids assuming that Luke recounted this event out of order, as The N arrated Bible  does. 7 In John 5 the text does not say that this was the Passover, only that \u201c there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .\u201d There were three feasts that could only be celebrated in Jerusalem: Passover (in April), Pentecost (in June), and Tabernacles (in September or October), and this could have been any of these. Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary  says, \u201c our opinion [is] that this unnamed feast a. was one of the three pilgrim feasts; b. must be dated in the year 28 A.D.; and c. was, in all probability , either Passover or feast of Tabernacles (without ruling out the possibility that it was Pentecost). In favor of the Passover two additional arguments are sometimes presented: 1. this is supported by the tradition of Irenaeus, an d 2. this was the only feast which the Israelites were required to attend. However, the evidence is not entirely conclusive. \u201d This would put John 5 right before Luke 6, which happened in the spring at the wheat or barley harvest in April or May (see  also e ndnote 9 below). The dating of John 4 and John 6 is much clearer, since these can be calibrated with the other gospels, with about a y ear and 4 months between them. Contributor Vince Eilenberger  asked me to clarify this, and I know that others have had the same question. Thanks, Vince! 8 This case is difficult. For various reasons these passages in Matthew, Mark, and Luke all seem to clearly connect with their own con text, so in spite of the similarities, we must assume that the Luke case was a repeat of the Mark and Matthew teaching. 9 In the climate of Israel the grass is only green and fresh during the springtime, mainly April. In the winter it freezes, and  in the h ot, dry summer it dries out. This confirms John\u2019s statement that it was near the Passover, and his statement that there was \u201c plenty of grass \u201d (John 6:10). See this excellent YouTube v ideo about the four seasons in Israel  from one of my favorite YouTube channels, Sergio & Rhoda in Israel , who bring to us in living color so many Biblical places. 10 Before 10 -Sep.-2019 I had placed the end of the Great Galilean Ministry later, at Mark 10:1a, but multiple commentators place it here, includin g Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary . Jesus does return to Galilee after this, but his ministry is more private from this point on , which is the point of John 7:1 according to Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary . The next period is one I call \u201cChange of Focus\u201d: see my comments on it in A Bird\u2019s Eye View of Jesus\u2019 Ministry . 11 In October, 2019, I moved this line up to follow Mark\u2019s order, since this is the only time The Narrated Bible  does not follow Mark except when there is a conflict with John\u2019s order. (See the discussion at Yellow background  above.) 12 Perea is th e region east of the Jordan and south of the Decapolis. Unlike the Decapolis, it was a mainly Jewish region, and like Galilee , it was ruled by Herod Antipas. It is never mentioned by name in the Bible, but it was \u201c the region of Judea beyond the Jordan \u201d men tioned in Matthew 19:1 and Mark 10:1, and was where Bethany beyond the Jordan was, mentioned directly in John 1:28 and indirectly in John 10:40. There was clearly a \u201cMinistry in Perea\u201d, which would include at the very least Matthew 19:1-20:16, Mark 10:1 -31, and John 10:40 -42, and because of parallels with Matthew and Mark, Luke 18:15 -30 as well. However, a number of commentators, including Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary  and The Narrated Bible , assume that Luke 13:22 also indicates this same period, since it says, \u201c He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. \u201d The normal route for Jews travelling from Galilee to Judea was through Perea, so as to avoid Samaria, and this would fit with the other gospels. This leaves  the question of how much of Luke 12:1 -18:14 to include: much of this material is unique to Luke, and what is not unique appear s to be more likely repeated teaching rather than true parallel passages (see [grey and  in brackets]  above). Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary  suggests that most of it could probably be included here, and I have followed their lead. 13 In April, 2021 I reali zed that the probability is that this passage terminates the Ministry in Perea, since Jesus does not return to Perea afterwar ds, so I moved it to its current position. 14 There is a complication in these three parallel passages: Matthew and Mark say that Je sus healed the blind men as he was leaving Jericho, but Luke says that it was as he was entering. Many explanations for this have been put forth, but Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary  simply says, \u00ab The best answer is, There is a solution, for this \u201cScriptur e,\u201d too, is inspired. However, we do not now have the solution to these problems .\u00bb The Narrated Bible  had changed Luke\u2019s order, but since this does not really resolve the issue, I have restored it. 15 This appears to be the only case of a serious change of order on the part of Mark, in which he takes a time out from his account of the events of Tuesday afternoon to relate an event that evidently occurred three days earlier, on Saturday. John clearly places this event on Saturday, and the three a ccounts must refer to the same event, since so many of the details match. Why both Matthew and Mark place this event in this context is not totally clear, but many commenta tors confirm that this is what they have done, includ ing Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary . 16 Because of its parallelism with the Matthew passage, Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary  presumes that Luke placed this out of order because of its subject matter, and this seems logical. 17 Tradition has always said that the Lord\u2019s supper took place on Thursday of Holy Week and that Jesus was crucified on Friday and was resurrected on Sunday. This neces - sarily means that Wednesday is not mentioned, presumably as a rest day for Jesus. However, in Matthew 12:40  Jesus says, \u201c For just as Jonah was three days and thre e nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. \u201d This has led some interpreters, including F. LaGard Smith in The Narrated Bible , on which I have based most of my chronology, to say that Jesus must have been crucified on Thursday. However, I find that most commentators, in cluding the Wycliffe Bible Commentary , Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary , and most of these comm entators , adhere to the traditional view, and give good arguments for this view, but I do not have space to include their arguments here.  Up until October, 2019 I had partially followed F. LaGard Smith in his interpretation; at that time I rear ranged or s implified a number of items, mostly following the Wycliffe Bible Commentary  and Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary , all adjustments marked with this footnote number 17. Chronology of the Four Gospels  10 Rick Aschmann, last updated 11-Feb-2022 18 In May, 2019, I significantly rearranged the material in the Lord\u2019s Supper  section, mostly following Baker\u2019s New Testament Commentary . Before that my analysis had been highly inconsistent, with several redundancies and not really following The Narrated Bible  or any other authority. 19 John the apostle, author of the fourth gospel, never mentions himself by name in his gospel, except indirectly as one of the two \u201csons of Zebedee\u201d in John 21:2 , apparently to show humility. Instead, he apparently refers to himself in other ways, as tradition  confirms. He is almost certainly the \u201cdisciple whom Jesus loved\u201d in John 13:23 -25, 19:26 -27, 20:2 -3, and 21:7,20. He is also probably the \u201cdisciple who testi fies\u201d in John 19:35 and 21:24. And in this role he is quite p robably the other disciple who is not named in John 1:35 -40 and in John 18:15 -16, since those passages have the appearance of being related by an eyewitness . See Apostles.html . 20 In January, 2019, I significantly rearranged the material in the Trial before the Jewish Authorities  section and the following section. See Peter\u2019 s Three Denials of Jesus . 21 These dark-green  quotes are the \u201cseven last words of Jesus on the cross\u201d. 22 According to this page  and many others, and general church tradition, Jesus rose from the dead on the Feast of Firstfruits, and  the Day of Pentecost occurred 50 days after the Feast of Firstfruits, leaving 10 days from the ascension to Pentecost. 23 In earlier versions of this article prior to March, 2021 , I had said that Kistemaker did the four gospels, but I had confused the two authors! 24 I have only included this information since June, 2020, as distinguished from actual parallel passages. 25 I only added these lines in April, 2021, because I realized that these breaks were hard to found without them, especially in long  sequences like Luke 12 -18.",
